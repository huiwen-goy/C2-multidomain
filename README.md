For the remainder, 212 emails failed; 3 emails were considered duplicates and skipped by Qualtrics; 2 opted out via Qualtrics; 26 responded to the invitation but declined to participate; and there was no response from the rest, except for a few who emailed the study coordinator directly to decline.
