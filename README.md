### Survey
The Qualtrics survey was emailed on Nov 8, 2019 to 1968 participants, based on a list of Stigma participants who consented to participate in further research and provided emails. 527 participants (26.8%) consented to participate in this survey from Nov 2019-Jan 2020.   
For the remainder, 212 emails failed; 3 emails were considered duplicates and skipped by Qualtrics; 2 opted out via Qualtrics; 26 responded to the invitation but declined to participate; and there was no response from the rest, except for a few who emailed the study coordinator directly to decline.
